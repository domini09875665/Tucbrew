# Tucbrew
A custom Hyundai headunit OS (CHHOS) called Tucbrew that means Tucson Homebrew.
It only supports the Hyundai Tucson 2018 Go! Edition, as to the owner owning the car.

Tucbrew is a custom hyundai headunit os, based on the Tucson TL18MY in the hyundai headunit upgrader. Tucbrew was made as a attempt to brake through the limits of what hyundai allows us. Tucbrew also contains a browser so you can look at wikipedia while driving, but we are still working on that. Tucbrew has its own start-up screen called "The White Flash", because of it having a white background and a "Tucbrew TM" text on the middle. Tucbrew is expected to get its first release out at 20.10.2024, because of testing and deving.
