# Tucbrew
A custom Hyundai headunit OS (CHHOS) called Tucbrew that means Tucson Homebrew.
It only supports the Hyundai Tucson 2018 Go! Edition, as to the owner owning the car.
(Note, it only support europe region as i am european and polish, so i wont like make multiple region editions. UK people can also download the same software from here when they have a Hyundai Tucson 2018 Go! Edition but its still not tested, so this os is a special os for the European region. Sorry america and asia or rest.)

Tucbrew is a custom hyundai headunit os, based on the Tucson TL18MY in the hyundai headunit upgrader. Tucbrew was made as a attempt to brake through the limits of what hyundai allows us. Tucbrew also contains a browser but its still being made. With the amazing wallpaper, you will love this frimware BUT REMEMBER! its still in development.
